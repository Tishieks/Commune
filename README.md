# Commune
Real time speech translation
This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the PyQt6 library. The application allows the user to translate spoken words from one language to another using speech recognition and machine translation.

When the user clicks the “Click to commune” button, the application listens for audio from the microphone and uses Google’s speech recognition service to convert the audio into text. The recognized text is then translated into French using Google Translate and displayed on the screen. The translated text is also converted into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech service and played back to the user.

The application also has a feature that allows the user to exit it by saying “exit”. When this happens, the application closes itself.

The GUI of the application is designed with a dark theme and has rounded edges and buttons. The background color is a light shade of gray.

This code demonstrates how various technologies such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech can be integrated into a single application to create a useful tool for language translation.
