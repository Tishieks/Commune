# Commune
Real time speech translation
This code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the tkinter library. The application allows the user to translate spoken words from one language to another using speech recognition and machine translation.

When the user clicks the “Click to commune” button, the application listens for audio from the microphone and uses Google’s speech recognition service to convert the audio into text. The recognized text is then translated into French using Google Translate and displayed on the screen. The translated text is also converted into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech service and played back to the user.

This code demonstrates how various technologies such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech can be integrated into a single application to create a useful tool for language translation.
